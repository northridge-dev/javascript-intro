# Recalling the Last Value

Sometimes easily recovering the previous command is exactly what you need. But
what if you want to recall the **result** of the previous command?

Before you do anything else, try typing an underscore (`_`, shift + the dash/minus
key) and pressing `Enter`.

```javascript
> _
```

What happened? What do you think `undefined` means?

Now try typing in a number, pressing enter, and _then_ typing an underscore...

```javascript
> 5
5
> _
```

What happened when you pressed enter this time?

Let's try two more experiments. First, try doing a simple calculation and then
typing an underscore and pressing enter:

```javascript
> 5 + 3
8
> _
```

Did you expect that?

Finally, try using the underscore in a calculation:

```javascript
> _ + 2
```

Before you press enter, predict what you think will happen.
_Hint: consider what value `_` had in your previous experiment.\_

Were you right? Explain to yourself what that underscore character is doing and
why it might be useful. When you're ready, click the âœ“ button.
