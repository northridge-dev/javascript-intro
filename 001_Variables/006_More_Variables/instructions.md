# More Variables

You've already created several variables. You called one of them by a
single-letter name: `x`. The others had more meaningful names:
`theMeaningOfLife` and `someNegativeNumber`. While it's easier to type `x` than
`theMeaningOfLife`, it's easier to understand what code is doing when
variable names are more descriptive. In JavaScript, most programmers use
"camel case" names: when you're smashing together several words to describe the
value being stored:

- omit spaces
- the first word is lowercase
- each subsequent word is capitalized

The capital letters make the word have humps, like a camel. You don't _have_ to
use camel case, but it makes longer names easier to read.

Let's create a few descriptive variables:

```javascript
let age = 12;
let grade = 7;
let heightInInches = 60;
```

Feel free to use your own age, grade and height when setting these variables.
For practice, confirm that you can recall the value of each.

So far we've created a lot of variables and set an initial value. But you can
also use variables in calculations:

```javascript
let firstTestScore = 85;
let secondTestScore = 90;
firstTestScore + secondTestScore;
// 175
```

You can also use variables to store the result of a calculation:

```javascript
let sumOfTestScores = firstTestScore + secondTestScore;
sumOfTestScores;
// 175
```

You can even use a variable to update its own value:

```javascript
sumOfTestScores = sumOfTestScores + 100;
sumOfTestScores;
// 275
```

That works because the JavaScript engine first **evaluates** the right side of
the assignment: it looks up the value of `sumOfTestScores`, adds `100` to it,
and then assigns the result of the calculation back to `sumOfTestScores`.

Try to think of another case where you might create a variable and use its
current value to reassign or update its value. Test it out. Once you've got it,
