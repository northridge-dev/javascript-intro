# More Variables

You've already created several variables. You called one of them by a
single-letter name: `x`. The others had more meaningful names:
`luckyNumber` and `negativeNumber`. While it's easier to type `x` than
`luckyNumber`, it's easier to understand what code is doing when
variable names are more descriptive. In JavaScript, most programmers use
"camel case" names: when you're smashing together several words to describe the
value being stored:

- omit spaces
- the first word is lowercase
- each subsequent word is capitalized

The capital letters make the word have humps, like a camel. You don't _have_ to
use camel case, but it makes longer names easier to read.

Let's create a few descriptive variables:

```
age = 12
grade = 7
heightInInches = 60
```

Feel free to use your own age, grade and height when setting these variables.
For practice, confirm that you can recall the value of each.

_Challenge_: can you use height in inches to calculate height in centimeters
(assuming 1 inch is equal to 2.54 centimeters)?

If you've created `age`, `grade`, and `heightInInches` variables and confirmed
that you can retrieve their values, you're ready to click the âœ“ button.
