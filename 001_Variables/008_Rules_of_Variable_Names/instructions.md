# What _Can't_ You Use as a Variable Name?

We've talked briefly about what makes a good variable name. We also described
meaningless variable names like `x` as "bad" in the sense that they aren't
especially clear or helpful. But they are valid. Not all variable names are.

Here are a few things to keep in mind when naming variables:

1. Variable names are case-sensitive. `myVariable` is different from `MyVaRiAbLe`.
2. Variable names can't contain spaces. `my variable` is invalid.
3. Variable names can't start with a number. `1variable` is invalid.
4. Variable names can't contain special characters like `!` or `@`.

Try creating a few variables with invalid names. What happens?

names, click the âœ“ button.
