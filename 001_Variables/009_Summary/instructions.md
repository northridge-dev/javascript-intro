# Summary: REPLs and Variables

Congrats! You made it through the first set of challenges. Before moving on to
the next, let's review what you've learned. You have the REPL here in case you
want to double check anything.

Do you remember . . .

1. What REPL stands for?
2. How to get back to a previous command you'd run in a REPL session?
3. What a JavaScript variable is?
4. What the special `_` variable points to?
5. What the keyword `let` is used for?
6. How a variable created with the `const` keyword differs from a variable
   created with the `let` keyword?
7. How to assign a value to a variable when you're first creating it?
8. How to change the value of a variable?
9. Why most lines of JavaScript end with a semicolon?

If you don't remember (or if you're not sure), go back to previous challenges
to review.
