# What's a String?

A **string** is just text data, a sequence of characters.

A string can be:

- empty

```javascript
let emptyString = "";
```

- a single character

```javascript
let lowercaseA = "a";
let smileyFace = "üòä";
let firstLetterOfHewbrewAlphabet = "◊ê";
let space = " ";
let number = "1";
```

- a word

```javascript
let butterfly = "Schmetterling";
```

- a sentence

```javascript
let typingPractice = "The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog.";
```

A string can even contain a whole book.

To create a string, you need to enclose the text in quotation marks. You can use
single or double quotes, but they have to match.

```javascript
let singleQuotes = 'Hello, World!';
let doubleQuotes = "Hello, World!";

// but never...
let mismatchedQuotes = 'Hello, World!";
```
