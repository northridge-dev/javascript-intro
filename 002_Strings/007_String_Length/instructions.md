# String Length

All strings have a `length` property that tells you how many characters are in
the string. Here's how you can ask for a string's length:

```javascript
const longWord = "antidisestablishmentarianism";
const length = longWord.length;
console.log(length); // 28
```

Do you think the `length` property counts spaces? Or does it count letters?
Get the tests to pass and you'll find out.
