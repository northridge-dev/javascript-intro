# Searching Strings, Part 1

In JavaScript, strings have **_properties_** like `length` and **_methods_**
like `concat`. We've now seen examples of both.

Let's look at a few more _methods_ we can use to inspect the contents of a
string. In the starter code, I've used the `includes` method. It does just what
you'd think: it tests if the string _includes_ or contains a "substring". Before
you run the code, guess what the output will be.

Try some more examples. Make up a new text or test for different substrings.
Does `includes`:

- distinguish between upper and lower case?
- work with spaces?
- work with numbers?

Now that you know how `includes` works, follow the instructions in the starter
code comments to pass the tests.
