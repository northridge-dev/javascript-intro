# Practice: Calculator Functions

Let's practice what you've learned. To pass the tests, you'll need to define 3
functions:

- `add`: takes two inputs and returns the sum
- `multiply`: takes two inputs and returns the product
- `divide`: takes two inputs and returns the quotient (the first input divided
  by the second)

If you run into problems, try troubleshooting. You can `console.log` function
calls or variable values to get a better sense of what's happening.
