# Debugging Challenge

It's rare that code works the first time. In the editor, you'll see a function
that has at least one (and maybe two) _bugs_ (errors). See if you can find and
fix them. Change inputs and inspect the outputs (using `console.log`) to help
you see what's going wrong.

The tests should pass once you've fixed all the bugs.

## Hints

The function uses a few methods that you might not be familiar with. Good
programmers use documentation to understand unfamiliar functionality.

- `charAt` is another way to get the **char**acter **at** an index. Here are
  some [examples](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/charAt#using_charat){:target="\_blank"}.
- `slice` is a way to get the part of a string between a starting index and an
  ending index. Here are some [examples](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/slice#using_slice_to_create_a_new_string){:target="\_blank"}
