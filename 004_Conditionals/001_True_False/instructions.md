# True, False

So far, you've seen mostly **numbers** and **strings**. JavaScript (and every
other programming language I know) also has **Boolean** values. There are only
two possible Boolean values:

- `true`
- `false`

You can set a variable equal to a Boolean like so:

```javascript
let codingIsHard = true;
let schoolIsBoring = false;
```

Booleans are really useful. In this set of challenges, we'll see how Booleans
help us choose which code to execute (and which code to skip).

## Tests

Create the following variables and assign them a Boolean value (`true` or `false`):

- `isRaining`
- `isTuesday`
- `isCodingRad`
