# Mini Project: Grade Calculator

Time to put what you've learned about conditionals to use.

The code in `index.html` renders a web page with an input box and a button. It
also has a bit of JavaScript that manages the button click. _You don't need to
modify anything in the HTML file._

**Your job is to write the logic for the `calculateGrade` function defined in
`script.js`.**

Use your expertise with conditionals -- `if`, `else if`, and `else` -- to
calculate the letter grade based on the user's input:

- 98-100: A+
- 95-97: A
- 93-94: A-
- 90-92: B+
- 87-89: B
- 85-86: B-
- 82-84: C+
- 79-81: C
- 77-78: C-
- 74-76: D+
- 70-73: D
- below 70: F

Try your grade calculator after -- just be sure to press the play button to
reload your code. There are tests, too. Click the check mark to run them. You'll
have to toggle from the "Web Page" to the "Test Results" tab to see the results.
