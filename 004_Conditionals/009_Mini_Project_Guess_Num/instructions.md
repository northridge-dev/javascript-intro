# Mini Project: Number Guessing Game

Let's build a number guessing game.

The code here will look very similar to the grade calculator you just built.
Like the last project, **you don't need to modify anything in `index.html`.**

**Your job is to write the logic for the `checkGuess` function defined in
`script.js`.**

`checkGuess` should:

- return `TOO LOW` (all caps) if the guess is less than `secretNumber`
- return `TOO HIGH` (all caps) if the guess is greater than `secretNumber`
- return `INVALID GUESS` (all caps) if the guess is less than the lower bound or
  greater than the upper bound
- return `CORRECT` (all caps) if the guess is correct

After making changes, be sure to press the play button to load your updated
code.

## Tests

Don't forget to test your code by pressing the check mark button. The tests
expect the same output described above.
