# Just a List

**Arrays** are **ordered lists** of values. The starter code has a few examples.

To create an array, use square brackets and separate each item with a comma.

## Tests

To pass the tests, create a variable called `testArray`. It should:

- have exactly 5 items
- the first item should be a number
- the fourth item should be a string
- the fifth item should be a boolean (`true` or `false`)
