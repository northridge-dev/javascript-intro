# CHALLENGE: Swap First and Last

Using what you've learned about arrays, write a function `swap` that takes an
array and returns an array that:

- has as its first element the last element of the input array
- has as its last element the first element of the input array
- all the values in between remain the same

Put another way, `swap` _swaps_ the first and last elements on the input array.
