# CHALLENGE: Reverse Range Generator

You've had a lot of practice building a range generator with a `while` loop. But
let's see if you can rework the function so that it can **also** generate
**reversed** ranges. If the `start` parameter is greater than the `end`
parameter, the resulting range should be in reverse order. For example:

```javascript
makeRange(5, 10); // [5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
makeRange(10, 5); // [10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5]
```

This challenge isn't easy. If you've worked on it for a while and can't make
progress, it's okay to skip ahead.
