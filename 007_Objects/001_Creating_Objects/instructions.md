# Creating Objects

An **object** is a collection of key-value properties. The key is a string, and
the value can be any data type: strings, numbers, arrays, functions, or even
other objects.

Here's the simplest way to create an object:

```javascript
const class = {
  name: 'Web Development',
  period: 5,
  students: ['Robert', 'Bob', 'Rob', 'Bobby', 'Roberto'],
}
```

Key points:

- Use curly braces `{}` to create an object
- Use a colon `:` to separate the key from the value
- keys are strings but don't require quotation marks
- key-value paris are separated by commas

## Tests

Create an object and store it at a variable named `student`. The object should
have a property `name` with a string value and an `age` property with a number
value.
