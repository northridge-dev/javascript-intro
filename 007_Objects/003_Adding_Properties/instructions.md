# Adding Properties

So far, we've added properties to objects when we created them. You can also add
properties to an object after it's been created using either **dot notation** or
**bracket notation**. Run the code in the editor to see an example.

**Note**: Notice that when you print the object, the key `'New York'` has
quotation marks. If a key has spaces or certain special characters, you **must**
use quotation marks when using it and you thus **cannot** use dot notation.

## Tests

Add two more properties to `teamsByCity`:

1. key: `Chicago`, value: `["Cubs", "White Sox"]`
2. key: `"Kansas City"`, value: `"Royals"`

```

```
